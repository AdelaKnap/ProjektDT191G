            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep a First Aid Kit Handy:</strong> Have a well-stocked first aid kit in accessible spots
                    at home (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, and car) so you can easily reach it in an emergency.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow the ABC Rule:</strong> In an emergency, always remember "A" (Airway), "B"
                    (Breathing), and "C" (Circulation). It helps you prioritize the correct actions!</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Be Afraid to Use an AED:</strong> Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) can save
                    lives during cardiac arrest. If you have access to one, practice using it so you're confident in a
                    real emergency.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create an Emergency Backpack:</strong> Fill a backpack with essentials such as water, food,
                    flashlight, batteries, a first aid kit, and a power bank. Keep it easily accessible and update it
                    regularly!</li>
                <li><strong>Know Your Nearest Escape Route:</strong> In case of emergencies like fires or natural
                    disasters, make sure you know two escape routes from your home and practice getting there quickly.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Have a Communication Plan:</strong> In a crisis, it’s vital to be able to reach your family.
                    Agree on a safe meeting place and have a communication plan in case phone lines are down.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare for Power Outages:</strong> Keep battery-powered flashlights, chargers, and spare
                    batteries at home. A small solar-powered flashlight or radio can be invaluable if the power goes
                    out.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Creative with Cooking:</strong> If you need to survive without electricity for several
                    days, keep food that can be eaten without cooking or cooked over an open fire. Canned goods, nuts,
                    dried fruit, and bars can be lifesavers.</li>
