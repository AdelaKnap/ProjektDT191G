                    <strong>Keep a First Aid Kit Handy:</strong>
                    <p>Have a well-stocked first aid kit in accessible spots at home (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, and car)
                        so you can easily reach it in an emergency.</p>

                    <strong>Follow the ABC Rule:</strong>
                    <p>In an emergency, always remember "A" (Airway), "B" (Breathing), and "C" (Circulation). It helps
                        you prioritize the correct actions!</p>

                    <strong>Don’t Be Afraid to Use an AED:</strong>
                    <p>Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) can save lives during cardiac arrest. If you have access
                        to one, practice using it so you're confident in a real emergency.</p>

                    <strong>Create an Emergency Backpack:</strong>
                    <p>Fill a backpack with essentials such as water, food, flashlight, batteries, a first aid kit, and
                        a power bank. Keep it easily accessible and update it regularly!</p>

                    <strong>Know Your Nearest Escape Route:</strong>
                    <p>In case of emergencies like fires or natural disasters, make sure you know two escape routes from
                        your home and practice getting there quickly.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong>Have a Communication Plan:</strong>
                    <p>In a crisis, it’s vital to be able to reach your family. Agree on a safe meeting place and have a
                        communication plan in case phone lines are down.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong>Prepare for Power Outages:</strong>
                    <p>Keep battery-powered flashlights, chargers, and spare batteries at home. A small solar-powered
                        flashlight or radio can be invaluable if the power goes out.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    <strong>Be Creative with Cooking:</strong>
                    <p>If you need to survive without electricity for several days, keep food that can be eaten without
                        cooking or cooked over an open fire. Canned goods, nuts, dried fruit, and bars can be
                        lifesavers.</p>
